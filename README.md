There is a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection">dataset</a> on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a> website which I used here in order to predict whether a row contains information about an abnormal network connection. 
<br/>
In this project, I used a neural network, an SVM, and a stochastic gradient descent model and employed ensemble learning techniques over the three mentioned models to get the best possible accuracy.
<br/>
You can also run this project on Colab with this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YLQ37jIeat3rsnLNv89aSyrXD6VZgSPg?usp=sharing">link</a>.
